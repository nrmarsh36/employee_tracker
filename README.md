# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

I was able to get the bare bones of the app working, which is a plus for me at this stage. I was able to set up the databases as well. 

As far as functionality goes, I am having difficulty with several tables correlating the role id numbers and departments in order to display all members of a particular department. When I try to delete an employee the results are all undefined. I was able to get the "add employee" function working, though I had to make a workaround for the table by adding a title column to the employee table.
